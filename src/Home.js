        <h1>WHAT IS THE NAATI CCL TEST</h1>
        <p>
        The Credentialed Community Language Test, known as the CCL Test, is an interpreting test for evaluation of your language quality and capabilities in community level. In this test, candidates interpret a conversation between an English speaker and a Language Other Than English (LOTE) to demonstrate accurate comprehension of each language.

        During CCL Test, an audio recording is played by a test officer which includes topics in Australian society such as health, legal, immigration, finance, housing, education, etc.

        CCL Test candidates after passing the ccl exam are only able to claim 5 bonus points for their visa applications in subclass of 189,190, and 491 and NOT working as a certified interpreter or translator.
